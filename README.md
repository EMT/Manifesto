## Make stuff because it feels good
- To feel like we did when we were kids, playing with lego or coding on a ZX Spectrum in Basic
- To make the ideas in our heads into tangible things

## Make stuff to change the world
- To push things, however little, in a direction we’d like to see the world move
- To support other people who are doing the same

## Collaborate, don’t compete
- Work together to make things better
 
## Make friends
- Build networks & communities
- Collaborate

## Enjoy what we do
- Make things we’re proud of
- Work with friends
- Always be tinkering

## Provide opportunities
- Work with organisations doing good things to help them further their work
- Work with young people who are interested in making things

## Work in public
- Share our ideas
- Be transparent
- Outward facing

## Value people
- Work with people with knowledge and skills that we don’t
