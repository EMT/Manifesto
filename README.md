# Manifesto

A working draft.

## Make stuff because it feels good
- To feel like we did when we were kids, playing with lego or coding on a ZX Spectrum in Basic
- To make the ideas in our heads into tangible things

## Make stuff to change the world
- To push things, however little, in a direction we’d like to see the world move
- To support other people who are doing the same

## Collaborate, don’t compete
- Work together to make things better

## Better, not more
- Don’t worry about growth, it’s not sustainable and it’s not important
- Make stuff, iterate, think, make better stuff
- Buy right, buy once
 
## Make friends
- Collaborate
- Communicate
- Always be contributing
- Help out
- Build networks & communities

## Enjoy what we do
- Make things we’re proud of
- Work with friends
- Always be tinkering
- Don’t become too busy

## Provide opportunities
- Help others who are doing good things
- Get people excited about making things (and changing the world)
- Work with young people

## Work in public
- Share our ideas
- Be transparent
- Outward facing

## Value people
- Work with people with knowledge and skills that we don’t 
- Work with people who can teach us things (and remember that we can learn from anyone)
- No-one should ever have to feel like a cog in a machine
