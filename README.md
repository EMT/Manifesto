# Manifesto

## Make stuff because it feels good
- To feel like we did when we were kids, playing with lego or coding on a ZX Spectrum in Basic.
- To make the ideas in our heads into tangible things.

## Make stuff to change the world
- To push things, however little, in a direction we’d like to see the world move.
- To support other people who are doing the same.
